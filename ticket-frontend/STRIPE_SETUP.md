# Stripe Integration Setup

## ✅ Changes Made

I've successfully integrated Stripe payment processing into your ticket app! Here's what was added:

### 1. **New Component: StripePaymentForm.js**
   - Created a complete payment form component with card input
   - Handles payment confirmation with Stripe
   - Shows loading states and error messages
   - Includes test card information for users

### 2. **Updated EventDetails.js**
   - Added payment form display logic
   - Integrated payment success handling
   - Connected to backend payment confirmation endpoint
   - Smooth transition from payment to confirmation screen

### 3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created `.env` file for configuration
   - Supports environment variables for Stripe key and API URL

## 🔑 IMPORTANT: Get Your Stripe Key

You need to add your Stripe publishable key to make payments work:

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. **Copy your test publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
3. **Update the `.env` file** in `ticket-frontend/`:
   ```
   REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE
   ```

## 🚀 Testing the Integration

1. **Start your backend server** (make sure it's running on port 8081)
2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd ticket-frontend
   npm start
   ```
3. **Create a test event with a price** (e.g., $10.00)
4. **Try to purchase tickets**
5. **Use test card**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Any future expiry date (e.g., 12/25)
   - Any 3-digit CVC (e.g., 123)
   - Any ZIP code

## 📝 Test Scenarios

### Free Events (Price = $0)
- Payment is automatically confirmed
- No payment form shown
- Instant reservation confirmation

### Paid Events (Price > $0)
- Stripe payment form appears
- Card details required
- Payment processed through Stripe
- Confirmation shown after successful payment

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

1. **"Invalid Stripe key" error**
   - Make sure you've added your Stripe publishable key to `.env`
   - Restart the React development server after adding the key

2. **Payment form not showing**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify the backend is returning `clientSecret` in the payment intent response

3. **Payment fails**
   - Check that your Stripe secret key is correctly set in the backend
   - Verify the backend `.env` has: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...`

4. **CORS errors**
   - Make sure your backend allows requests from `http://localhost:3000`

## 🎉 Success!

Your app now has full Stripe payment integration! The flow is:
1. User selects tickets
2. Backend creates payment intent
3. Frontend shows payment form
4. User enters card details
5. Payment processed through Stripe
6. Backend confirms order
7. User sees confirmation

Remember to switch to live keys when going to production!
